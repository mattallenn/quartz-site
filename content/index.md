title: About Me 
---

Hello! I'm Matt, a Computer Science student at Purdue University.  

This website is meant to be multipurpose--a portfolio, a wiki, a [Resume](Resume.md) and a home for anything else I want to publish.
 
**Note: this website is NOT complete, some links don't work. I'm actively fixing this.**
## [Projects](Projects.md)

[Passman](passman.md) is a command-line based password manager with encryption, cloud syncing, and more!

[cspeed](cspeed.md) is a simple, fast, lightweight typing speed game written in C.
mdVimScode](VimScode.md) is a NeoVim plugin that helps open VSCode for faster debugging.

## Interests

I enjoy coding (obviously), but I also like to play drums, snowboard, BMX, and build whatever I can. 

I'm a big open-source advocate, and love using open-source projects such as [NeoVim](neovim.md) and [Linux](linux.md)
